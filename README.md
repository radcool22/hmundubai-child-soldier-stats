Notes Document for HMUN Dubai 2025


General Topic Information: 

300,000 children are believed to be serving as soldiers in armed conflicts. 

Girls are often forced into sexual slavery. 

These children fight on the front lines and participate in suicide missions as spies, messengers, or general soldiers.

About 65,000 children have been released from armed forces in the past decade according to UNICEF. 

The conflicts in Sierra Leone that have been documented heavily have further increased the attention provided towards the topic.
 
The Children, Not Soldiers campaign was an initiative by UNICEF for the issue.
 
Children were killed and maimed in the Israel-Palestine conflict, primarily the Gaza Strip in 2023, where the most grave violations happened.

In 2023, violence towards child soldiers increased rapidly by 21%. 

Central Africa and Middle Eastern countries such as Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria , the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen are the most targeted.

Most countries have parties which recruit and use child soldiers, and some of those parties are even the countries’ own security forces.

According to UN, a party can engage in 5 aspects of child recruitment:
Recruit and use children
Kill and maim children
Rape and perform sexual violence on children
Attack schools or hospitals
Abduct children

Some parties even have connections with the United Nations and continue to commit grave violations such as South Sudan.

Canada is one of the strongest advocates for the prevention of child recruitment. 

In the Secretary General’s report, she urges for: 
Parties to adhere to international humanitarian law.
Parties to avoid using explosive weapons in populated areas.
Countries to become parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.
Implementation of the Paris Principles (promoting and protecting human rights).
Civilian objects to be protected such as hospitals and schools.
Provision of protection services to former child soldiers.
Releasing children from places of detention in Iraq and Syria due to probable involvement with armed parties. 
More donors for funding towards child protection facilities on the ground.


Solutions (derived from action plans generated by the UN and my own ideas):

Criminalize the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and issue a military order to stop and prevent child recruitment.

Investigate and prosecute those who recruit and use children.

Appoint child protection specialists in security forces.

Release all children identified in the ranks of security forces.

Provide regular, unimpeded access to military camps and bases so child protection actors can verify that no children are in the ranks.

Provide release and reintegration programmes for children.

Strengthen birth registration systems and integrate age-verification mechanisms in recruitment procedures.

Implement national campaigns to raise awareness and to prevent the recruitment of children.

Enhance cooperation with local and international NGOs working on child protection to facilitate the release and reintegration of children.


Ireland’s Involvement in the Issue:

Ireland ratified the Optional Protocol in November of 2002. 

Along with ratifying the protocol, Ireland also released a declaration stating “the minimum age for recruitment into the Irish armed forces is 17. An exception is made in the case of apprentices, who may be recruited at the age of 16. However, apprentices are not assigned to any military duties until they have completed up to four years apprenticeship trade training, by which time all would have attained the age of 18”.

The declaration also stated that recruitment of children under 18 is not forced or coerced, that all applicants are required to provide proof of age, and that unmarried applicants under the age of 18 must have parental consent.

Ireland has backed efforts to combat the use of child soldiers in the United Nations Security Council meeting, when Ireland’s representative said that "the issue of children in armed conflict is of particular concern to the Irish Government and Ireland strongly supports international efforts to strengthen the level of protection available to children affected by armed conflict".


Important Documents:

Optional Protocol on the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC): It aims to protect children from being recruited and used in hostilities and came into force in 2002. It states to:
Not recruit children under 18 to fight in armed conflict.
Not conscript soldiers under 18.
Prevent the recruitment of children under 18 through legislation.
Demobilize anyone under 18 who has been conscripted or used in hostilities.
Provide physical, psychological, and social reintegration services to those who have been demobilized.

Paris Commitments: They are a set of political commitments to protect children from being recruited or used by armed forces or groups. The commitments include:
Supporting the implementation of the Paris Principles (basic human rights).
Putting in place measures to prevent the recruitment and use of children.
Supporting the release, reintegration, and recovery of children who have been recruited and used

Secretary General's Reports: These are released every year and provide a detailed analysis on the recruitment and use of child soldiers worldwide, containing both statistics and information. 


Causes of Child Recruitment:

Poverty

Economic exploitation

Lack of income

Conflict and Instability

Manipulation

Family and peer pressure

Traditional roles of men in war

Weak governance

Lack of education


DDR Programs:

Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration programs for child soldiers help them transition to civilian life after war.

Children are separated from the armed forces they are associated with. This can involve negotiations with armed groups or government troops freeing the children. 

Children can undergo rehabilitation to help them transition to civilian life. 

Children can be reunited with their families.

Children can receive essential services like reproductive health care. 

Children can be reintegrated into the community. 

Children can undergo psychosocial approaches like emotional expression, group and individual counseling, and cultural rituals.

Children can be placed in schools, colleges, or universities.

Children can be given tool kits to help them find work.

DDR programs need to be well planned out for large scale releases of children.


Key Issues:

Grave Violations Against Children: The documents highlight various grave violations against children in armed conflict, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, killing and maiming, sexual violence, attacks on schools and hospitals, and abduction. These violations are reported across multiple countries and by different armed groups.


Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers: The recruitment and use of child soldiers is a recurring and significant concern across multiple conflicts and regions. The reports detail the number of children recruited in various countries, and the groups responsible for these violations. The International Child Soldier Index notes that the statistics are likely a small fraction of the actual numbers.


Impact of Armed Conflict on Children: Armed conflicts have a severe impact on children, violating their rights to life, family, health, development, and protection. Children are vulnerable to physical, human, moral, and cultural destruction.


Data Collection and Verification: The UN vets the information contained in the reports for accuracy, qualifying unverified information and noting when incidents are verified at a later date. However, the reports acknowledge that the information presented does not represent the full scale of violations due to various factors including access.


Accountability: The documents call for accountability for perpetrators of grave violations against children. They encourage efforts to ensure that those who commit these violations are held responsible.


Humanitarian Access: Restrictions to humanitarian access are a significant concern, impeding the work of UN and child protection actors.


International Cooperation: There is an emphasis on the importance of international cooperation to prevent grave violations, foster partnerships on child protection, and provide financial and technical assistance. The need for member states to engage with the UN is also highlighted.


Reintegration: The documents discuss the need for reintegration programs for children affected by armed conflict, including community sensitization and psychological support.


Safe Schools Declaration: The importance of implementing the Safe Schools Declaration and protecting educational institutions from attacks is emphasized.



United Nations and NGO Initiatives:


UN Security Council Resolutions: The reports are submitted pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1612 (2005) and 2427 (2018), which outline the framework for monitoring and reporting on grave violations against children.


Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict: The Special Representative plays a key role in promoting the protection of children and engaging with parties to conflict.


Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism: The UN utilizes a monitoring and reporting mechanism to document and verify violations against children.


Action Plans: The documents highlight the implementation of action plans with various governments and armed groups to end and prevent grave violations.


UNICEF: UNICEF plays a significant role in advocating for children's rights, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting reintegration programs.


War Child: War Child provides integrated programs that include child protection, education, psychological support and livelihood training.
